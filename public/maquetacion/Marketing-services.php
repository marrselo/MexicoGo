                            In Canada, nearly 100% of all homes are online. Canadians are one of the most connected consumer groups on the planet and their standards demand a high quality online experience. 
Whether looking for real estate, travel or retirement information, Canadians have come to expect informative websites that are easy to use and that appeal to their esthetic taste. Naturally reserved and independent, Canadians often prefer to do the legwork themselves and Mexi-Go! provides current information about buying real estate, travel and retirement in Mexico. We also cover the issues that matter such as healthcare, moving to Mexico, taking your pets to Mexico, taxes, insurance and much more!
